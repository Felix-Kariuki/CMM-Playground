## Project structure

### Modules

### 1.shared

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, that is, the code you share between platforms.

This `shared` module is also where you‚Äôll write your Compose Multiplatform code.
In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt`, you can find the shared root `@Composable` function for your app.

It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in `shared/build.gradle.kts`.
The `shared` module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### 2.androidApp

This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
The `androidApp` module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular Android library.

### 3.iosApp

This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application.
It depends on and uses the `shared` module as a CocoaPods dependency.

### 4.desktopApp

This is a Kotlin module that builds into a desktop application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The `desktopApp`
module depends on and uses the `shared` module as a regular library.
